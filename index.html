        <h3>About Myself</h3>
        <p class="intro">
            I am Danny Harani, an aspiring software engineer and developer from <span id="Montreal">Montreal</span>, now living in Ottawa. I am in grade 12 at AY-Jackson secondary school.
            Computer programing has been an interest of mine for as long as I can remember and I started really looking into it when I was about 11 years old with basic block-type coding.
            When I was 14, I took it on to myslef to start learning to code. I used online resources, primarily <a href="https://www.youtube.com">youtube</a> to learn coding on my own.
            I started with basic variable video's and learned up to loops. I then made simple input output type of games like hangman or rock paper scissors. When I felt confident in my abilities,
            I decided to learn python so I can diversify my knowledge in programing. However, I lost interest since I did not know what I should code, I had no inspiration. 
            I took a break and decided to see what grade 10 compsci would teach me. I designed a simple game for little kids in elementary with actionscript and enjoyed the project.
            It boosted more of my creativity and I decided my break was over. <br> <br>
            
            The year after, I learned C++ in grade 11, this programing language was more familiar to me than actionscript and I enjoyed it. This is where I am today,
            I am learning Javascript and the DOM through online resources like Khan academy and FreeCodeCamp. This portfolio will display 10 things I learned and why I enjoyed them. Here's a quick list of 
            the coding languages I enjoyed learning (in no order):<br><br>

            <ul>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Javascript</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>Kotlin</li>
                <li>C++</li>
            </ul>

            <span class="highlight">Before I continue, I would also like to mention some hobbies that aren't programing related:</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Soccer</li>
                <li>Volley Ball</li>
                <li>Driving</li>
                <li>Paint-balling</li>
                <li>Learning</li>
            </ul>
