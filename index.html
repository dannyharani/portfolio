        <h3>About Myself</h3>
        <a href="https://github.com/dannyharani/portfolio">My Repository</a>
        <p class="intro">
            I am Danny Harani, an aspiring software engineer and developer from Montreal, now living in Ottawa. I am in grade 12 at AY-Jackson secondary school.
            Computer programming has been an interest of mine for as long as I can remember and I started really looking into it when I was about 11 years old with basic block-type coding.
            When I was 14, I took it on to myslef to start learning to code. I used online resources, primarily <a href="https://www.youtube.com">youtube</a> to learn coding on my own.
            I started with basic variable video's and learned up to loops. I then made simple input output type of games like hangman or rock paper scissors. When I felt confident in my abilities,
            I decided to learn python so I can diversify my knowledge in programming. However, I lost interest since I did not know what I should code, I had no inspiration. 
            I took a break and decided to see what grade 10 compsci would teach me. I designed a simple game for little kids in elementary with actionscript and enjoyed the project.
            It boosted more of my creativity and I decided my break was over. <br> <br>
            
            The year after, I learned C++ in grade 11, this programming language was more familiar to me than actionscript and I enjoyed it. This is where I am today,
            I am learning Javascript and the DOM through online resources like Khan academy and FreeCodeCamp. This portfolio will display 10 things I learned and why I enjoyed them. Here's a quick list of 
            the coding languages I enjoyed learning (in no order):<br><br>

            <ul>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Javascript</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>Kotlin</li>
                <li>C++</li>
            </ul>

            <span class="highlight">Before I continue, I would also like to mention some hobbies that aren't programming related:</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Soccer</li>
                <li>Volley Ball</li>

        <h2>My favorite projects</h2>
        <p>Here is a list in no particular order of my 10 favorite projects / modules: </p>
        
        <!-- 1 -->

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Paint Splatter</h3>

            <div class="embed">
                <script src="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-paint-splatter/6197740044763136/embed.js?editor=yes&buttons=yes&author=yes&embed=yes"></script>
            </div>
            
            <p class="highlight">
                This project is the first that really showed me the power of javascript. I used objects, functions, loops, arrays and much more to create something I believe is beautiful. It is not complex, but I feel like it was a nice introduction to what I could start doing. 
                As a student, it taught me that most concepts of almost any course are related in some fundamental way. For example, the arrays are just a represent of a set, which we intuatively know as a group of similar "things". An array of arrays is a multiset in that same way!
                functions are algorithms called upon when needed, similarly to when solving a puzzle like a rubics cube. I learned a lot about clearing my misconceptions that courses are their own entities. They are all part of the same idea!
            </p>

            <h3>Guessing game</h3>
            <div class="embed">
                <script src="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-memory/4588095890997248/embed.js?editor=yes&buttons=yes&author=yes&embed=yes"></script>
            </div>
            <p class="highlight">
                Games and Visualisations in Khan Academy really re-introduced me to the ability of being creative while coding. Although the concepts were all covered in previous modules, I enjoyed the 'free-ness' of this section 
                since I believe the best way to learn is through having fun and experimenting. Games and Visualisations allowed me to do just that, experiment. Being told what to do is a very unengaging way of learning
                and I appreciated this new approach.
            </p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Mountain range</h3>
            <div class="embed">
                <script src="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-mountain-range/6242436041359360/embed.js?editor=yes&buttons=yes&author=yes&embed=yes"></script>
            </div>
            <p class="highlight">
                This specific project from natural simulations was quite fun for me, I would say the most fun from this section. The concept were complex yet easy to grasp and allowed me to use that creativity from games and Visualisations.
                My basic idea coming into this portion was to draw an irregular cirle using the noise but that evolved into drawing clouds with that same noise, an abstract sun with sun rays that I really had to ponder with using sin and cos. 
                This third module shows an evolution from my first two which were much less creative and felt bland. Although games and Visualisations allowed me to show that creativity, I guess I was nervous to do so and this project helped me overcome that.
                However, I did come up with a complaint while programming this, I now realise I do not understand the fundamental reason why my code works since it is abstracted with sin and cos, It should be more intuitive than how it is.

            <h3>Creature comforts and critter jitters</h3>
            <div class="embed">
                <script src="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-creature-comforts-and-critter-jitters/5001190274711552/embed.js?editor=yes&buttons=yes&author=yes&embed=yes"></script>
            </div>
            <p class="highlight">
                I abandoned creativity in this module to try and represent as accurately as I could the interaction of a 'fly' with its environement.
                The main idea is that the fly will be attracted to some food while being repelled from the predators. I believe I did a pretty decent job of doing just that,
                in some situations, the fly escapes the frame to not be seen again which made me happy, sometimes an environement is not suited for the creature or even a person 
                which is why the fly would leave if it is too dangerous for it to stay. I learned a lot about how to use physics concepts while programming thanks to this module.

            <h3>Interactive Slideshow with JQuery</h3>
            <div class="embed">
                <script src="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-interactive-slideshow/6379222665216000/embed.js?editor=yes&buttons=yes&author=yes&embed=yes"></script>
            </div>
            <p class="highlight">
                JQuery is a great tool to personallise and make your webpage interactive. This JQuery module was a great tool to learn online and understand how to implement different
                kinds of libraries on your website. This section also helped me understand that you do not need to create everything from scratch and you can use other peoples work to
                improve your own. Now this does not mean that you can steal, but you can implement instead! I was always "iffy" on taking other people's work but if noone ever borrows others'
                efforts, noone would ever create anything new. I am glad this module made me understand that I can be more productive by using libraries and improving my work with them. 
                Although I did not add too much complexity to this code, it is very expandable and modular. For example, I could use an array and have next go to next index and loop once it reaches the last
                and have previous do the same but for the previous index. This is just a thought but simply implementing this with that simplicity is enough to grasp the concept.

            </div>
            <p class="highlight">
                This project encapsulated almost all of natural simulations and animation. I learned a lot from this experience, doing extra research online from sources like stack overflow
                and other communities of the sort. I believe learning is impossible without a community around you. I am glad this project pushed me outside of my comfort zone and taught me
                that asking questions and not understandind on the first try is completely normal. I did not ask any question on these websites since I had answers from others' asking the same questions
                however, I can see myself asking many, many <strong>many</strong> questions in the future. The actual project itself used many math concepts like angle and distance, I am looking for a 
                way to implement more rational math like quadrance and spread but without success so far since I have been taught classical math for too long. This is a goal for my future!

                This module, from Intro HTML and CSS sparked my passion to learn for myself. I was not quite happy with having simply met the guidlines on this one, so I went on a little bit of a online search
                to personallise the website to my liking. This project impacted me in two significant ways, the first being to never overlook the details and the second being to ask for help. Many of my previous 
                misconceptions about HTML code were cleared up and this course was what triggered that for me.

            <p class="highlight">
                This module gave me insight on so many computer science and programming concepts. It taught me the basics of good programming practices, really deepend my understanding of conditionals, loops and variable types while also keeping me 
                entertained. This knowledge is useful and certainly important, but not as much as what I learned about being a contributer and using other's contributions. Although this was not a specific topic in itself, clearness of code is deaply
                engrained in this module. This is how you can get others to provide valuable insight on your program, since no one wants to work deciphering your logic. This is the most important aspect I have learned, and hopefully you can see it 
                shine through my code.
                <br>
                <br>
                I completed all of Computer Science Principles, and although I won't have a seperate module in this portfolio to describe each seperately, I would like to quickly mention other things I learned: how to keep information secure, 
                how to simulate real world scenarios, how the internet and the world wide web work and many other computer science topics.

                Metaballs is a project I am very proud of. There is still much to improve, like everything else, but I believe it is my most refined work to date. I used all the aspects I learned from Khan Academy and 
                other online resources such as the Coding Train, youtube videos, and online articles. I really learned how to do profound and meaningful research. This is also the first project in which I included 
                my learning community as part of the code. I tried to help my community learn about classical physics concepts and how to include them in the program. I used classical math to ensure the class understands
                what I am saying as it is the most commonly taught, I was also selfish as I did not try to use rational math. This was on purpose, however; since I believe it is not as intuitive as classical math for me at the moment.
                I tried learning for myself and this makes me very proud. I applied concepts of loops, arrays, objects and multiple variable types. I am still thinking about how to understand the concepts I am using in this project in 
                terms of rational mathematics and know it will be a impactful addition to my learning in the future. <a href="https://github.com/dannyharani/metaballs-refactor">Here is a link to the repository for the code.</a>

                even after this course ends. This palindrome project was a different experience for me since I had to to do it without the hand holding Khan Academy was providing. It somehow felt more professional and I
                believe this is what it will feel like in a real job environement. Being tested and having to learn different environements was fun for me! <a href="palindrome-checker.txt" target="_blank">Link to code</a>

    <div class="description" id="MY_QUESTIONS">

        <h2>Three Questions</h2>
    
        <h3 class="question_text">1. What makes object oriented design integral to how you think about coding/programming/computer science?</h3>        

        <p class="highlight">
            I conceptualize objeects as a sort of data type in programming. They become useful especially when the code is especially large and contains many similar groups of variables. These groups of variables often describe an identical
            property but are different values depending on what is being described. As an example, people can be described using identical variables, all having different values. Names will be names but be different on the person,
            eye color, race, height, gender and so on. Objects help programmers like myself simplify this repetitiveness with classes and objects.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are four main aspects of object oriented design: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. All of these concepts help me think more critically and abstracly while programming. The first is abstraction.
            This concept helps me think broader while trying to simulate an object. Instead of saying this container is 50 centimeters tall, I now thing: this container is some height. This adds flexibility to my code. Next is encapsulation.
            With this idea, I now group related variables together to create a blueprint that is easier to think about. This helps with thinking critically. The next two are more abstract. 
            Inheritance is the idea that most things come from a same idea, but have their own modifications. While programming, I think about how an object can be further grouped in its own category. In essence, it is the creation of
            a hierarchy of objects. Polymorphism is the final concept that strengthens how I think of programming in an object oriented manner, it provides me with the ability to think of how an object can be unique even within its group.
            These ideas together create a way of thinking more abstractly and solve problems with the knowledge that I already have from other problems. Every problem is from the same set as another that has already been solved.
        </p>

        <h3 class="question_text">2. How will you continue learning about computer science?</h3>

        <p class="highlight">
            Learning is a combination of multiple things. There is no one thing that is considered learning. Schools promotes learning through repetition and listening to lectures. I am a good student and get good grades, but this is not what I 
            consider learning to be. The way I learned to program is what I consider learning. Of course repetition is needed for improvement, but it is not the basis of learning.
            In my opinion, learning is understanding.
            <br>
            <br>
            Before I took computer science in shool, I learned coding on my own looking for resources. I used what was available to me and tried looking for what interested me most. Learning, in my opinion, is about interest. With interest usually comes 
            understandind. The more you enjoy doing something the more your brain subconciously tries to understand it. To continue my own personal learning, I will continue finding things I
            am interested in within the field of computer science. Of course, I need the help of the coding and programming community, I will use the internet for most of the questions I have and learn in that manner.
            However, this has its limits. I need to find something that is more tangible to translate my ideas into reality so to speak. I was introduced to cubing in this course and I find that to be a great object for me to manipulate my thoughts.
        </p>

        <h3 class="question_text">4. What should one take note of on your portfolio?</h3>

        <p class="highlight">
            Portfolios are a way to demonstrate one's work and effort. This is precisely the mentality I had while making this one. I was inspired by many websites and portfolios I researched. Here are a couple: <br> <br>
            <a href="https://toyfight.co/">Toy Fight</a> <br>
            <a href="https://activetheory.net/home">Active Theory</a> <br>
            <a href="https://lusion.co/">Lusion</a> <br> <br>
            These three websites were the most insperational for me, they had so much creativity and beautiful interfaces that allow the visitor to have a stunning experience. These website are years in the making 
            which is different from what my portfolio can boast. So instead of showing the most refined products like these did, I wanted to show an evolution in my thought process through the course. I cut corners on projects that I felt were completed enought
            for myself. This is not for lack of motivation, but for the desire to do more. I would include more than 10 projects, show the most refined ones, but I believe this is the most pure way I can show who I am as a learner. I also took great care on the 
            layout and desing of the website. I designed it with Adobe Xd, used Visual Studio code to put everything up and used Javascript code snipets to add some creativity.
