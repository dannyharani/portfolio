        <h3>About Myself</h3>
        <p class="intro">
            I am Danny Harani, an aspiring software engineer and developer from <span id="Montreal">Montreal</span>, now living in Ottawa. I am in grade 12 at AY-Jackson secondary school.
            Computer programing has been an interest of mine for as long as I can remember and I started really looking into it when I was about 11 years old with basic block-type coding.
            When I was 14, I took it on to myslef to start learning to code. I used online resources, primarily <a href="https://www.youtube.com">youtube</a> to learn coding on my own.
            I started with basic variable video's and learned up to loops. I then made simple input output type of games like hangman or rock paper scissors. When I felt confident in my abilities,
            I decided to learn python so I can diversify my knowledge in programing. However, I lost interest since I did not know what I should code, I had no inspiration. 
            I took a break and decided to see what grade 10 compsci would teach me. I designed a simple game for little kids in elementary with actionscript and enjoyed the project.
            It boosted more of my creativity and I decided my break was over. <br> <br>
            
            The year after, I learned C++ in grade 11, this programing language was more familiar to me than actionscript and I enjoyed it. This is where I am today,
            I am learning Javascript and the DOM through online resources like Khan academy and FreeCodeCamp. This portfolio will display 10 things I learned and why I enjoyed them. Here's a quick list of 
            the coding languages I enjoyed learning (in no order):<br><br>

            <ul>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Javascript</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>Kotlin</li>
                <li>C++</li>
            </ul>

            <span class="highlight">Before I continue, I would also like to mention some hobbies that aren't programing related:</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Soccer</li>
                <li>Volley Ball</li>
                <li>Driving</li>
                <li>Paint-balling</li>
                <li>Learning</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>My favorite projects</h3>
        <p>Here is a list in no particular order of my 10 favorite projects / modules: </p>
        
        <!-- 1 -->

        <div class="project">
            <h2>Paint Splatter</h2>

            <div class="embed">
                <script src="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-paint-splatter/6197740044763136/embed.js?editor=yes&buttons=yes&author=yes&embed=yes"></script>
            </div>
            
            <p class="highlight">This project is the first that really showed me the power of javascript. I used objects, functions, loops, arrays and much more to create something I believe is beautiful. It is not complex, but I feel like it was a nice introduction to what I could start doing. </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 2 -->

        <div class="project">
            <h2>Guessing game</h2>
            <div class="embed">
                <script src="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-memory/4588095890997248/embed.js?editor=yes&buttons=yes&author=yes&embed=yes"></script>
            </div>
            <p class="highlight">
                Games and Visualisations in Khan Academy really re-introduced me to the ability of being creative while coding. Although the concepts were all covered in previous modules, I enjoyed the 'free-ness' of this section 
                since I believe the best way to learn is through having fun and experimenting. Games and Visualisations allowed me to do just that, experiment. Being told what to do is a very unengaging way of learning
                and I appreciated this new approach.
            </p>

        <!-- 3 -->

        <div class="project">
            <h2>Mountain range</h2>
            <div class="embed">
                <script src="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-mountain-range/6242436041359360/embed.js?editor=yes&buttons=yes&author=yes&embed=yes"></script>
            </div>
            <p class="highlight">
                This specific project from natural simulations was quite fun for me, I would say the most fun from this section. The concept were complex yet easy to grasp and allowed me to use that creativity from games and Visualisations.
                My basic idea coming into this portion was to draw an irregular cirle using the noise but that evolved into drawing clouds with that same noise, 
                an abstract sun with sun rays that I really had to ponder with using sin and cos. This third module shows an evolution from my first two which were much less creative and felt bland. Although games and Visualisations allowed me to 
                show that creativity, I guess I was nervous to do so and this project helped me overcome that.

        <!-- 4 -->

        <div class="project">
            <h2>Creature comforts and critter jitters</h2>
            <div class="embed">
                <script src="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-creature-comforts-and-critter-jitters/5001190274711552/embed.js?editor=yes&buttons=yes&author=yes&embed=yes"></script>
            </div>
            <p class="highlight">
                I abandoned creativity in this module to try and represent as accurately as I could the interaction of a 'fly' with its environement.
                The main idea is that the fly will be attracted to some food while being repelled from the predators. I believe I did a pretty decent job of doing just that,
                in some situations, the fly escapes the frame to not be seen again which made me happy, sometimes an environement is not suited for the creature or even a person 
                which is why the fly would leave if it is too dangerous for it to stay. I learned a lot about how to use physics concepts while programing thanks to this module.
