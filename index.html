        <h3>About Myself</h3>
        <p class="intro">
            I am Danny Harani, an aspiring software engineer and developer from Montreal, now living in Ottawa. I am in grade 12 at AY-Jackson secondary school.
            Computer programing has been an interest of mine for as long as I can remember and I started really looking into it when I was about 11 years old with basic block-type coding.
            When I was 14, I took it on to myslef to start learning to code. I used online resources, primarily <a href="https://www.youtube.com">youtube</a> to learn coding on my own.
            I started with basic variable video's and learned up to loops. I then made simple input output type of games like hangman or rock paper scissors. When I felt confident in my abilities,
            I decided to learn python so I can diversify my knowledge in programing. However, I lost interest since I did not know what I should code, I had no inspiration. 
            I took a break and decided to see what grade 10 compsci would teach me. I designed a simple game for little kids in elementary with actionscript and enjoyed the project.
            It boosted more of my creativity and I decided my break was over. <br> <br>
            
            The year after, I learned C++ in grade 11, this programing language was more familiar to me than actionscript and I enjoyed it. This is where I am today,
            I am learning Javascript and the DOM through online resources like Khan academy and FreeCodeCamp. This portfolio will display 10 things I learned and why I enjoyed them. Here's a quick list of 
            the coding languages I enjoyed learning (in no order):<br><br>

            <ul>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Javascript</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>Kotlin</li>
                <li>C++</li>
            </ul>

            <span class="highlight">Before I continue, I would also like to mention some hobbies that aren't programing related:</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Soccer</li>
                <li>Volley Ball</li>
                <li>Driving</li>
                <li>Paint-balling</li>
                <li>Learning</li>

        <h2>My favorite projects</h2>
        <p>Here is a list in no particular order of my 10 favorite projects / modules: </p>
        
        <!-- 1 -->

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Paint Splatter</h3>

            <div class="embed">
                <script src="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-paint-splatter/6197740044763136/embed.js?editor=yes&buttons=yes&author=yes&embed=yes"></script>
            </div>
            
            <p class="highlight">This project is the first that really showed me the power of javascript. I used objects, functions, loops, arrays and much more to create something I believe is beautiful. It is not complex, but I feel like it was a nice introduction to what I could start doing. </p>
        </div>

            <h3>Guessing game</h3>
            <div class="embed">
                <script src="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-memory/4588095890997248/embed.js?editor=yes&buttons=yes&author=yes&embed=yes"></script>
            </div>
            <p class="highlight">
                Games and Visualisations in Khan Academy really re-introduced me to the ability of being creative while coding. Although the concepts were all covered in previous modules, I enjoyed the 'free-ness' of this section 
                since I believe the best way to learn is through having fun and experimenting. Games and Visualisations allowed me to do just that, experiment. Being told what to do is a very unengaging way of learning
                and I appreciated this new approach.
            </p>

            <h3>Mountain range</h3>
            <div class="embed">
                <script src="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-mountain-range/6242436041359360/embed.js?editor=yes&buttons=yes&author=yes&embed=yes"></script>
            </div>
            <p class="highlight">
                This specific project from natural simulations was quite fun for me, I would say the most fun from this section. The concept were complex yet easy to grasp and allowed me to use that creativity from games and Visualisations.
                My basic idea coming into this portion was to draw an irregular cirle using the noise but that evolved into drawing clouds with that same noise, 
                an abstract sun with sun rays that I really had to ponder with using sin and cos. This third module shows an evolution from my first two which were much less creative and felt bland. Although games and Visualisations allowed me to 
                show that creativity, I guess I was nervous to do so and this project helped me overcome that.

            <h3>Creature comforts and critter jitters</h3>
            <div class="embed">
                <script src="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-creature-comforts-and-critter-jitters/5001190274711552/embed.js?editor=yes&buttons=yes&author=yes&embed=yes"></script>
            </div>
            <p class="highlight">
                I abandoned creativity in this module to try and represent as accurately as I could the interaction of a 'fly' with its environement.
                The main idea is that the fly will be attracted to some food while being repelled from the predators. I believe I did a pretty decent job of doing just that,
                in some situations, the fly escapes the frame to not be seen again which made me happy, sometimes an environement is not suited for the creature or even a person 
                which is why the fly would leave if it is too dangerous for it to stay. I learned a lot about how to use physics concepts while programing thanks to this module.

            <h3>Interactive Slideshow with JQuery</h3>
            <div class="embed">
                <script src="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-interactive-slideshow/6379222665216000/embed.js?editor=yes&buttons=yes&author=yes&embed=yes"></script>
            </div>
            <p class="highlight">
                JQuery is a great tool to personallise and make your webpage interactive. This JQuery module was a great tool to learn online and understand how to implement different
                kinds of libraries on your website. This section also helped me understand that you do not need to create everything from scratch and you can use other peoples work to
                improve your own. Now this does not mean that you can steal, but you can implement instead! I was always "iffy" on taking other people's work but if noone ever borrows others'
                efforts, noone would ever create anything new. I am glad this module made me understand that I can be more productive by using libraries and improving my work with them. 
                Although I did not add too much complexity to this code, it is very expandable and modular. For example, I could use an array and have next go to next index and loop once it reaches the last
                and have previous do the same but for the previous index. This is just a thought but simply implementing this with that simplicity is enough to grasp the concept.

            <h3>Asteroids Spaceship</h3>
            <div class="embed">
                <script src="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-asteroids-spaceship/5890624113295360/embed.js?editor=yes&buttons=yes&author=yes&embed=yes"></script>
            </div>
            <p class="highlight">
                This project encapsulated almost all of natural simulations and animation. I learned a lot from this experience, doing extra research online from sources like stack overflow
                and other communities of the sort. I believe learning is impossible without a community around you. I am glad this project pushed me outside of my comfort zone and taught me
                that asking questions and not understandind on the first try is completely normal. I did not ask any question on these websites since I had answers from others' asking the same questions
                however, I can see myself asking many, many <strong>many</strong> questions in the future. The actual project itself used many math concepts like angle and distance, I am looking for a 
                way to implement more rational math like quadrance and spread but without success so far since I have been taught classical math for too long. This is a goal for my future!

            <h3>Word game</h3>
            <div class="embed">
                <script src="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-word-game/5415843851091968/embed.js?editor=yes&buttons=yes&author=yes&embed=yes"></script>
            </div>
            <p class="highlight">
                This is another example of JQuery which implements the form input methods. This is again a simplified version of what I could do, however I now understand the basic concept and can improve 
                my ideas with additional loops or objects. This is an example of how to take a new concept and applying it to your previous knowledge. I will use many of these Khan Academy modueles
                for this soul purpose. Pamella, the author of this course, did a great job teaching how to stack on top of previous knowledge.

            <h3>Bookshelf</h3>
            <div class="embed">
                <script src="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-bookshelf/6264689310515200/embed.js?editor=yes&buttons=yes&author=yes&embed=yes"></script>
            </div>
            <p class="highlight">
                Bookshelf is by no means a complicated program at all, but it taught me a lot. Not much in the term of coding or javascript, but in terms of best practices. This specific module is one that displays
                my improvement the best. The amount of modularity such a simple code has is by itself an achievement. I believe it is a great way to teach best practices in programing. 
                I used variables, objects, relevant naming of parameters and readable coding. There isn't much more you can ask of a programer!

            <h3>Metaballs</h3>
            <div class="embed">
                <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/danniharany/embed/uEYnGlfhm" height="420" width="420"></iframe>
            </div>
            <p class="highlight">
                Metaballs is a project I am very proud of. There is still much to improve, like everything else, but I believe it is my most refined work to date. I used all the aspects I learned from Khan Academy and 
                other online resources such as the Coding Train, youtube videos, and online articles. I really learned how to do profound and meaningful research. This is also the first project in which I included 
                my learning community as part of the code. I tried to help my community learn about classical physics concepts and how to include them in the program. I used classical math to ensure the class understands
                what I am saying as it is the most commonly taught, I was also selfish as I did not try to use rational math. This was on purpose, however; since I believe it is not as intuitive as classical math at the moment.
                I tried learning for myself and this makes me very proud. I applied concepts of loops, arrays, objects and multiple variable types.
